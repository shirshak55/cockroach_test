## Cockroach DB Benchmark.

This repository provides a simple benchmark suite for testing the performance of
CockroachDB under various configurations.

You can adjust benchmark parameters and database settings in the config.toml
file. Please review and update it according to your environment before running
tests.

### Disclaimer

Benchmarking is inherently complex and influenced by multiple factors such as
hardware, network latency, configuration, and workload design. As such, the
results produced by this benchmark may not fully represent real-world
performance. Use the results as a general indicator rather than an absolute
measurement.
